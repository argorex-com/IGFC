# 🏛️ ARGOREX | Incident Governance Framework (Community)

This framework is built on a simplified and amplified [**VERIS Taxonomy**](https://verisframework.org/index.html) (Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing), enhanced with Argorex proprietary Business and Impact Logic.

## 🔍 Methodology: The 5-Pillar Analysis

This framework analyzes every incident through a high-resolution lens to ensure risk is managed:

- **Business Context:** We categorize the incident by industry sector and organizational scale to align technical risks with specific regulatory and market environments.
- **Actor & Intent (Who/Why):** We distinguish between accidental friction and Organized Crime. Identifying the Type is critical for determining the persistence and sophistication of the threat.
- **Action & Asset (How/Where):** We map the attack vector against the specific asset.
- **Attributes:** We measure the impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- **Impact:** We translate technical failures into business consequences.

## 📈 Rating Matrix Definitions

* **MAJOR:** Real and serious effect on the long-term ability to generate revenue.
* **MODERATE:** Measurable operational disruption. Requires immediate capital allocation for remediation.
* **MINOR:** Tactical incident. Managed within existing operational budgets but logged for trend analysis.
* **NONE:** No impact detected on business assets or operations. Logged for baseline security posture.
* **UNKNOWN:** Insufficient data to determine impact. Requires immediate forensic escalation.

## ❓ How to use it?

* **Log Incidents:** Use the **'Incident'** tab to record events using the VERIS-aligned taxonomy.
* **Reporting:** The data structure is ready to be connected to any visualization engine (Power BI, Tableau, or Google Sheets).

## 🌐 Open Source Commitment

At Argorex, we believe that Resilience is a Global Standard. By releasing this framework as an Open Methodology, we empower the community to move beyond "check-the-box" security and toward setting up the foundations for Quantitative Risk Management.
